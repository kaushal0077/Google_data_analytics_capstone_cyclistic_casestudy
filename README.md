## INTRODUCTION
The goal of this project is to analyze the data from Cyclistic bike share company in Chicago. The company has two types of users: casual riders (who buy one-time passes) and members (who subscribe annually). With 5884 bikes at 692 stations, the company wants to attract more annual members for financial stability and customer loyalty.

By looking at the data, we aim to find patterns and insights that will help the company convert more casual riders into annual members. This information will be valuable for creating effective marketing strategies to encourage people to choose the annual subscription instead of just one-time passes. Ultimately, the focus is on growing the number of annual members to ensure the company's long-term success.

## BUSINESS TASK
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently ?
